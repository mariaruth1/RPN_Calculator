RPN Flutter Calculator
======================

Welcome to the RPN Flutter Calculator, a modern take on the classic Reverse Polish Notation calculator built with Flutter. This app is designed to perform complex calculations using the postfix notation for operations including addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`). It's built to adapt dynamically to different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a seamless user experience across a wide range of devices.

Features
--------

*   **Reverse Polish Notation**: Supports basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) in RPN, allowing for efficient and complex calculations without the need for parentheses.
*   **Dynamic Text Resizing**: Text size adjusts dynamically to ensure readability and optimal use of screen real estate.
*   **Orientation Support**: Fully supports both portrait and landscape modes, automatically adjusting the layout to fit the screen.
*   **Stack Display**: Visually displays the contents of the stack, providing a clear view of all numbers currently being worked with.
*   **Calculation History**: Shows the most recent calculation performed, making it easy to track operations.
*   **Input Display**: Displays currently input numbers, ready to be added to the stack.
*   **Scrollable Display**: All display components (stack, calculations, input) are scrollable, ensuring that overflow is gracefully handled and all content remains accessible.
